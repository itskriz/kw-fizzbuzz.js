kw-fizzbuzz.js
======

A simple web developer aptitude test using JavaScript.

Given that FizzBuzz is all the rage lately, I figured I'd try my hand at it. I've never been asked for this in an interview but and kind of wish I had been asked this every time.

## Usage

The script will output an unordered list with results.

To generate default FizzBuzz results (range 1-100, fizz 3, buzz 5):
```
fizzBuzz();
```

You can customize the range, fizz, and buzz values by passing parameters to the function:
```
fizzBuzz( rangeMin, rangeMax, fizzValue, buzzValue );
```
